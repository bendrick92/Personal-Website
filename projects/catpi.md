<h3>Background</h3>
<p>With two cats in the house, making sure my fiance and/or I are always available for meals can be a challenge.  Between hectic work schedules and out-of-town trips, the idea of a remote cat feeder became extremely appealing.  However, with off-the-shelf options out of the budget, I employed a bit of Google-Fu and came across an awesome <a href="http://drstrangelove.net/2013/12/raspberry-pi-power-cat-feeder-updates">project by David Bryan</a>.  Using some servos and a repurposed cereal dispenser, he had built his own Raspberry Pi-powered cat feeder!</p>
<p>Using David's project as inspiration, I whipped together a few Python scripts, added a custom enclosure, a Pi Camera module, and the ability to operate the feeder remotely using a Dropbox "schedule" file.</p>
<p>The resulting product, affectionately known as "Jeeves" around the house, is still used almost daily.  I have plans to update the scripts to allow for different sized portions, as well as a web-based interface to manage the schedule, view pictures, etc.  In addition, I'd like to revise the feeder design to dispense separate, equal sized portions into bowls.</p>
<h3>Objectives</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Learn how to wire a servo</li>
    <li>Learn how to utilize Dropbox SDK</li>
    <li>Create a cat-proof feeder design</li>
    <li>Learn how to use the Pi Camera</li>
</ul>
