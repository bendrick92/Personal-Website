<h3>Background</h3>
<p>After graduating in 2014 and moving to Minnesota, I made a number of friends in local car clubs.  Thanks to the awesome communities there, I found myself attending more events, meets, and just spending more time around cars.  As it was such a big part of my life, I found myself wanting to share my experiences with others and decided to start a new blog dedicated solely to my hobby.</p>
<p><a href="https://benscarblog.com">Ben's Car Blog</a> was originally launched as a subdomain of bpwalters.com.  A few months and articles later, I finally had the time to dedicate to designing a new, separate site for my car content.  Rather than copy an existing theme, I decided to take the time and create a new design from scratch.  I spent a few weeks researching car blogs, and took a lot of my inspiration from sites like <a href="http://nickscarblog.com">nickscarblog.com</a> and <a href="http://claveyscorner.com">claveyscorner.com</a>.  As it turns out, there just aren't that many personal car blogs!</p>
<p>Overall, I had a lot of fun designing the site.  Thanks to <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, creating new content and expanding the site is super easy.  Beyond some new posts, I don't have any plans to expand the functionality of the site at this time.</p>
<h3>Objectives</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Design a responsive, minimalist layout</li>
    <li>Utilize high quality photos to enhance content</li>
    <li>Create a documented history of my cars</li>
    <li>Generate a journal-like repository of mods, maintenance, and experiences for my cars</li>
    <li>Create and maintain a supporting Instagram account</li>
</ul>
