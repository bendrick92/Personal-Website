<h3>Background</h3>
<p>After publishing my original <a href="/raspberry-pi-obdii-carputer/">Raspberry Pi Carputer</a> post, I was pleasantly suprised to discover the number of people working on the same types of projects.  Through emails, Reddit threads, and in-person discussions at conferences, I realized there was much more interest in Raspberry Pi/carputer projects than I had first thought!  Unfortunately, I also realized there were a number of limitations with the Raspberry Pi approach (namely boot time and power requirements).</p>
<p>As a result, I began exploring alternatives, which eventually led me to the Arduino community.  Through some Googling, I discovered a company called <a href="http://www.freematics.com/">Freematics</a> which specializes in automotive Arduino applications.  Thanks to Freematics' awesome documentation and OBD-II adapter, I was able to realize my original dream of a standalone in-car performance monitor.  While I had pivoted from my initial design of an integrated, all-in-one carputer, I saw a new opportunity to replicate the type of portable, configurable monitoring provided by the <a href="https://www.cobbtuning.com/products/accessport">COBB Accessport</a>.</p>
<p>Along the way, I gained a healthy appreciation for building GUIs from scratch while also refreshing my geometry skills (something I realized I really enjoy!).  Unfortunately, as with many of my projects, I haven't found the time to continue development.</p>
<h3>Objectives</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Learn how to develop with Arduino</li>
    <li>Learn how to design a GUI</li>
    <li>Build a real-time vehicle performance monitor</li>
    <li>Ensure fast boot, high portability</li>
</ul>
