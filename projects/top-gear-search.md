<h3>Background</h3>
<p>As an big fan of the British Top Gear, I found myself doing A LOT of Google searches to find specific episodes.  While the Amazon/Netflix descriptions were pretty helpful, they didn't provide much context on what cars were featured or what challenges/specials were in each episode.</p>
<p>I had been doing a lot of work learning how to build RESTful API's with a friend at the time, so I decided this would be a great opportunity to practice myself.</p>
<p>The resulting API and corresponding website utilize detailed episode descriptions from Wikipedia to provide real-time matching and recommendations based on user input.  I had used Google's auto-complete search suggestions as inspiration.  While it could certainly be improved, I'm very happy with the result.</p>
<p>I currently have no plans to enhance or add additional functionality to this site.</p>
<h3>Objectives</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Build a RESTful Rails API</li>
    <li>Get more experience with Backbone.js</li>
    <li>Replicate Google's auto-complete</li>
</ul>
