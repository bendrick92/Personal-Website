<h3>Background</h3>
<p>Minnesota is a great place to be a car nut.  With a huge variety of clubs, associations, and groups, there's no shortage of opportunities to stand around a parking lot and talk about cars!</p>
<p>One specific group I'm regularly involved with is MNSTs.  MNSTs is a group of primarily Ford Focus ST/RS and Fiesta ST owners.  Most of our members are active on our Facebook group, but a number of others don't even have Facebook accounts.  Since we do almost all of our event scheduling on our private Facebook group, making this information accessible to our other members became a problem that needed solving.</p>
<p>I came up with the idea of "scraping" various sources (such as forums, our Facebook wall, etc.) to aggregate member posts/group announcements into a centralized location.  This created a number of unique challenges, mainly figuring out how to scrape forum posts and recognize/render quotes and conversation threads in a readable format, all while keeping performance and load times in check.</p>
<p>Overall I am very proud of this project, even if its not used by a huge audience.  Keeping up with Facebook's continuous API update schedule has proven...frustrating.  However, the beauty of the site is that it sources its own content.  Each request refreshes a copy of the latest posts and renders a fresh copy for each visitor.</p>
<p>I haven't spent a lot of time on this project lately, as the group administrators and I have been working on a couple new ideas for a club website.</p>
