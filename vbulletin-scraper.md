            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>This project was designed as a Ruby gem to be implemented as the workhorse of the <a href="https://mnstoc.com/posts">mnstoc.com</a> post feed.</p>
            <p>This gem is able to scrape any compatible (only certain versions are currently supported) vBulletin forum thread for post content, while maintaining quotes/conversation structure.  In addition, this project provided the opportunity to explore test-driven development with RSpec.  Being a public gem, I wanted to be sure that it was reliable as well as functional.</p>
            <p>Beyond basic bug fixes and miscellaneous functionality implementation, this project is not regularly maintained.</p>
            <h3>Objectives</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Scrape vBulletin forum threads for post content</li>
