            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>The obdPi project was born out of a desire to build a custom boost gauge for my 2014 Fiesta ST.</p>
            <p>I had been inspired by the 2015 WRX's central multi-function display, and got to researching existing Raspberry Pi-based car computers (carputers).  I quickly realized that, while there were a number of great projects already out there, I could use this as an opportunity to learn more about the Raspberry Pi's capabilities, the OBD-II interface, as well as wiring and coding for 16x2 character OLED displays.</p>
            <p>In total, I spent probably about ten hours a week for a year coding, testing, learning, wiring, and troubleshooting.  Fortunately, the hard work paid off and I was able to get a fully working system up and running reliably in my car.</p>
            <p>Overall, obdPi has easily been my most challenging project, but also the most rewarding.  Unfortunately, due to time constraints and other projects, I haven't had a chance to revisit obdPi for some time.  I hope to get back into it some day soon!</p>
