                    <h2>Hi there, I'm Ben!</h2>
                </p>
                <p>I'm a web developer from Milwaukee, Wisconsin.</p>
                <p>Currently I'm a Senior Software Engineer with <a href="https://milwauketool.com">Milwaukee Tool</a>, but over the past six years I've worked with companies in the educational, publishing, medical certification, and manufacturing industries.</p>
                <p>I am passionate about finding elegant solutions to complex problems and creating user-friendly experiences across the web! I enjoy experimenting with new technologies and strive to continuously learn from those around me.</p>
                <p>When I'm not at work, I'm usually buried in a good book, hanging with my wonderful wife and our cat, or blogging over at <a href="https://benscarblog.com">Ben's Car Blog</a>.</p>
                <p>If you have any questions about my projects or are interested in working together, feel free to <a href="mailto:contact@bpwalters.com">shoot me an email</a>! I'd love to connect!</p>

                <h4>Amazon Affiliates Disclosure</h4>
                <p>Some of the links within this website utilize the <a href="https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/" target="_blank">Amazon Associates Program</a>, of which I am a participant. The Associates Program is designed as a means for me to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com products. Use of these links provide me with a small kickback.</p>
                <p>Content containing Amazon Associates links can be identified by the following:</p>
